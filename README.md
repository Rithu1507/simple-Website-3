# simple-Website-3
Completed Task 3 of my web development internship at ApexPlanet! This project focused on advanced styling and JavaScript, where I built a responsive website using media queries, created an interactive quiz, and fetched live data from an API to display dynamically on the webpage. Great hands-on experience!
